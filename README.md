# PHP-MySQL-Project
In this repository I will be posting my studies in PHP and MySQL, and with time it will turn into a website project!

This CRUD does the basic four operations: create, read, update and delete. I took the liberty to add more functions to it, and they are: sign up, login and automatically email send. When a client is registered in the system by an admin, the admin need to put the clients email so that the client is able to confirm that hes registration was succesfull. The client receives an email that shows him the password and the link, but the link is not functional, because i didn't put it online (yet), it can only run at local server.

It's currently functional, but I will add a logoff system and put it online for demonstration to my friends, family and companies that ask for me to make a CRUD system or show some knowledge with PHP and MySQL.
